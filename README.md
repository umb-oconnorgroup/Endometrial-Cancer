# Endoseq Project
# Genetic ancestries and their relationship with endometrial cancer outcomes

#Three main analyses: 
*  Density distribution of somatic variants per diplotype
*  Comparing Genome-wide average rate of somatic mutations across diplotypes in each individual
*  Firth Regression to explore the relationship of local ancestry with total mutation burden (TMB) and histopathological outcomes

Local ancestry was performed using RFMIX with four super population groups as references
